# MyReads Project

A React Single Page Application for organizing and keeping track of the books you read / want to read. You can search for more books using the search tool and move those books in your personal shelves. For every book are displayed: its title, authors and cover. The shelves you can split your books into are the following: Currently Reading, Want to Read, Read. When you move the book to 'none' it disappears from your shelves. 
This application is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)'s React Nanodegree.

## Installing the app
To start the application right away, you need to:
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`

## Backend Server
All http requests needed in order for the app to function properly are made in the file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) to the server provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).
